PixelFly is small tool to support pixelperfect CSS implementations.

Disclaimer

This project is not intended for productive use, really. It's not
tested. It is rather an educational project for myself.

Motivation
==========

Working in an environment where it is expected that you implement pixel
perfect layouts can be annoying. That's why I created this tool to make
it easier.
